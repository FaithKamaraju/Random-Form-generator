# Random Form Generator for Sketching Practice

I just built this quick app to help me practice some shapes and forms sketching.

Roadmap and planned features for this small app -

1. all the basic primitives in three.js
2. Randomizer that generates forms in different angles and different lighting
3. Camera controls to reposition the form as the user likes
4. Background envs and a perspective grid
5.

Maybe Features -

1. handling maybe complex meshes
2. Uploading custom models?
